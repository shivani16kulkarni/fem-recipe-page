## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The exercise turned out to be more challenging than I expected. Even though I'm pretty comfortable with using Flexbox to organize layouts, I found myself struggling with some of the smaller details, like line heights, font family changes, font weights, and customizing lists. Working through these basics ended up being really satisfying. It helped me strengthen my grasp of the core principles and get better at CSS styling overall.
